# TrustCore SDK

**TrustCore SDK** is a cross-platform security toolkit built for developers. It is entirely written in C and includes a quantum-safe cryptographic library, TLS 1.3 stack, and clients for MQTT, EST, SCEP, SSH, RADIUS, EAP and others. TrustCore SDK is compact, performant and modular, designed for secure connected devices. We’ve open-sourced the code under the AGPL v3 license to support transparency, collaboration, and developer accessibility, while maintaining commercial licensing for commercial and proprietary use.

## TrustCore SDK Overview  

TrustCore SDK is a powerful suite of security tools hardend over 15 years of usage, designed to simplify and enhance certificate-based authentication, encryption, and secure communications. Previously a closed-source solution, it is now being open-sourced to empower developers with greater flexibility in integrating robust security mechanisms into their applications.  

### **Key Capabilities**

- **Certificate Lifecycle Management** – Supports enrollment, renewal, revocation, and validation.  
- **PKI Integration** – Seamless interaction with public key infrastructure for secure identity verification.  
- **Secure Cryptographic Operations** – Provides efficient and compliant cryptographic functions.  
- **Trusted Platform Support** – Enables integration with TPMs and hardware security modules (HSMs).  
- **EST & CMP Protocol Support** – Implements industry-standard protocols for certificate provisioning and management.
- **Secure Device Communications** - Delivers MQTT (MQTTs) over TLS 1.3 for securing device communications.

### **Supported Protocols and How to Build**

TrustCore SDK provides comprehensive support for various security and communication protocols, ensuring secure interactions across different applications and environments:

- [NanoSSH](https://dev.digicert.com/en/trustcore-sdk/nanossh.html) – Secure Shell (SSH) implementation optimized for lightweight environments, learn to [compile here](https://dev.digicert.com/en/trustcore-sdk/nanossh/nanossh-client-user-guide/nanossh-client-overview.html#generate-nanossh-client-quick-build).

- [NanoMQTT]() - Secure MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for IoT and cloud communications.

- [NanoSSL](https://dev.digicert.com/en/trustcore-sdk/nanossl.html) - Implementation for SSL/TLS 1.3, providing secure transport layer encryption.

- [NanoSec](https://dev.digicert.com/en/trustcore-sdk/nanosec.html) – Strong encryption and security for network layer communications.

- [NanoEAP]() – Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for secure network authentication.

- [NanoCert](https://dev.digicert.com/en/trustcore-sdk/nanocert.html) – EST and SCEP Protocols for automated certificate enrollment and management.
