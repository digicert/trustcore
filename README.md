# TrustCore SDK

**TrustCore SDK** is a cross-platform security toolkit built for developers. It is entirely written in C and includes a quantum-safe cryptographic (PQC) library, TLS 1.3 stack, and clients for MQTT, EST, SCEP, SSH, RADIUS, EAP and others. TrustCore SDK is compact, performant and modular, designed for secure connected devices. We’ve open-sourced the code under the AGPL v3 license to support transparency, collaboration, and developer accessibility, while maintaining commercial licensing for commercial and proprietary use.

> 📢 **Update:** NanoSSH is now open-source under the [AGPL license](LICENSE.md).  
> All TrustCore SDK components are on track to be open-sourced progressively.

## TrustCore SDK Overview  

TrustCore SDK is a powerful suite of security tools hardend over 15 years of usage, designed to simplify and enhance certificate-based authentication, encryption, and secure communications. Previously a closed-source solution, it is now being open-sourced to empower developers with greater flexibility in integrating robust security mechanisms into their applications.  

### **Key Capabilities**

- **Certificate Lifecycle Management** – Supports enrollment, renewal, revocation, and validation.  
- **PKI Integration** – Seamless interaction with public key infrastructure for secure identity verification.  
- **Broad Cryptographic Algorithm Support** – From message digests to symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, TrustCore [NanoCrypto](https://dev.digicert.com/en/trustcore-sdk/nanocrypto.html) has you covered.  
- **Trusted Platform Integration** – Enables integration with TPMs and hardware security modules (HSMs).  
- **EST & CMP Protocol Support** – Implements industry-standard protocols for certificate provisioning and management.
- **Secure Device Communications** - Delivers MQTT (MQTTs) over TLS 1.3 for securing device communications.
- **PQC-ready** - Utilize the latest post-quantum cryptographic algorithms including: ML-KEM, ML-DSA and SLH-DSA, ensuring your devices are quantum-safe.
- **Modular and compact** - Each module is implemented in lightweight C code. Build only the required modules to minimize the device footprint.
- **FIPS 140-3 ready** - Need FIPS 140-3 certification? No problem! Contact us to learn more how we can help you certify your product.
- **OpenSSL Interop** - Provides a compatibility layer for applications using OpenSSL APIs, enabling seamless integration.
