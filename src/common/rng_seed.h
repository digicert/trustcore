/**
 * @brief    Collect and return the requested number of entropy bytes.
 * @details  This function will use a custom FIPS approved algorithm to collect
 *           entropy bytes to be used as seed material.  The entropy is created
 *           by a race condition between competing threads, interrupts, and
 *           other threads of execution within the device.  There will be a
 *           random number of context switches during the execution of the
 *           entropy seed generation, it is expected that this number will
 *           exceed 100 per second.
 *           <p>Upon the first call, this function will spawn three additional
 *           threads to execute simultaneously, each thread will interact
 *           differently with a common buffer(m_entropyScratch) to generate the
 *           seed value. The master thread will loop for the duration of the
 *           seed generation, continously calling RNG_SEED_scramble() then
 *           sleeping for t milliseconds : 0 < t < 256.
 *           <p>The three sibling threads all folow the same basic pattern of
 *           execution:
 *             1. Wait for all siblings to be ready for seed generation, each
 *                thread scrambles the buffer while waiting.
 *             2. Once all threads are ready, begin thread specific interaction
 *                with the entropy buffer (see documentation on each thread
 *                for more information).
 *             3. Each thread then completes its operation, marks itself as
 *                done, then continues its thread specific interaction until
 *                all of the other sibling threads are complete.
 *           Once all threads are done, the data is copied from the entropy
 *           scratch buffer into the entropy depot, then bytes are taken from
 *           entropy depot and placed into the input buffer.
 *
 * @param pDstCloneEntropyBytes  Pointer to a caller allocated buffer that will
 *                               recieve the entropy bytes after generation.
 * @param numEntropyBytes        Number of entropy bytes to collect.
 *
 * @return            \c OK (0) if successful; otherwise a negative number error
 *                    code definition from merrors.h. To retrieve a string
 *                    containing an English text error identifier corresponding
