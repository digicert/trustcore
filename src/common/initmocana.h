 * acquire it using AqcuireMocCtx. That function will use theMutex to increment
 * the refCount in a thread-safe way. When an object no longer needs the MocCtx,
 * call ReleaseMocCtx. That function will decrement the refCount.
 * <p>If the refCount goes to zero, the MocCtx is destroyed. In fact, MOCANA_free
 * will not actually free the MocCtx, it will only decrement the refCount. It is
 * a signed int so we can recognize errors if the count goes to negative values.

 *           the call to MOCANA_initialize returned an error.
 *           <p>This function will build a MocAlgCtx containing the Operators
 *           from the setupInfo, among other information. Some functions will

 *           there are NanoCrypto functions that you can call, because they don't
 *           require an AlgCtx. However, it does limit your possibilities.
 *           <p>The first call to this function is not thread safe.  Any further
 *           nested calls after the first call are thread safe however any nested
 *           calls much have a matching free call. Nested calls will not

 *           a parameter. Upon successful return, the PRNG will be instantiated
 *           at the location pointed to by \c g_pRandomContext.

/**
 * @brief    Release memory allocated by MOCANA_initialize().
 * @details  This function releases memory previously allocated by a call to
 *           MOCANA_initialize().  If the init function was called more than
 *           once before a free, this function will decrement the internal
 *           reference count and return \c OK.  When the reference count reaches
 *           zero, all memory allocated by MOCANA_initialize() will be freed
 *           and any associated tasks will be shut down.
 *           <p>If the original initialization call requested a static memory
 *           partition, this function will uninitialize all internal management
 *           operations for that static memory partition.
 *
 * @param    ppAlgCtx The address where the function will find an AlgCtx to free.
 *           The algCtx was created during the call to MOCANA_initialize. This
 *           can be NULL if the call to MOCANA_initialize did not request an
 *           AlgCtx.
 *
 * @return   \c OK (0) if successful; otherwise a negative number error code
 *           definition from merrors.h. To retrieve a string containing an
 *           English text error identifier corresponding to the function's
 *           returned error status, use the \c DISPLAY_ERROR macro.
 *
 * @par Flags
 * To enable this function, the following flag must \b not be defined
 *   + \c \__DISABLE_MOCANA_INIT__
 *   .
 * Additionally, whether or not the following flags are defined determines which
 * uninitialization functions are called
 *  + \c \__DISABLE_MOCANA_RAND_ENTROPY_THREADS__
 *  + \c \__DISABLE_MOCANA_STARTUP_GUARD__
 *  + \c \__DISABLE_MOCANA_TCP_INTERFACE__
