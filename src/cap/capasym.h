 * <p>This is generally called "Raw RSA".
 * <p>With this flag the input data must be the same size as the RSA modulus.
 * For example, with a 2048-bit key, the modulus is 2048 bits, which is 256
 * bytes. The input must be 256 bytes long. If the data is only 255 bytes long,

 * process.
 * <p>The result will be the same size as the modulus, with prepended 00 bytes if
 * the result is not exactly the length of the modulus.
 * <p>NOTE!!! The input, as an integer, must be less than the modulus. That is,
 * consider the input and modulus to be integers (as byte arrays, they are in
 * canonical format), make sure the input < modulus. You can do this if you make
 * the first byte of input (input[0]) to be 0. It is almost certain that the
 * first byte of the modulus will be 0x80 or greater. Hence, if the first byte of
 * input is 0x7F or less, then the input will be less than the modulus.
 * <p>If the key to use is a public key, call CRYPTO_asymEncrypt. If the key is
 * private, call CRYPTO_asymDecrypt. It is possible you are verifying a signature
 * and want to directly examine the decrypted signature. You still call

 * <p>Note that there is no OID for raw RSA, so there is no algId associated with
 * it. So if you encrypt or decrypt with this flag and call CRYPTO_getAsymAlgId,
 * you will get an error. There is no algId for this so you cannot call
 * asymEncrypt or Decrypt with an algId and get raw RSA, you must use the flag.

 * <p>The caller will digest the data to verify.
 * </pre>
 * <p>To get the Digest, you can use the MocSymCtx API, calling
 * CRYPTO_digestFinal to get the message digest.
 * <p>Incidentally, how does one know which digest algorithm to use? Generally,
 * when verifying, you will be given an algId which specifies the public key
 * algorithm, the digest algorithm, and if RSA, the padding scheme and
 * parameters. To get a digest object from an algId, call
 * CRYPTO_getDigestObjectFromSigAlgId. If you don't have an algId, then there was
 * some other method for communicating the algorithm details.
 * <p>Although the key is of a specific algorithm, there are further details
 * needed. For example, an RSA key can sign using RSA, but it must pad using
 * PKCS 1.5 or PSS.
 * <p>There are two ways to specify the details: one, with the algorithm
 * identifier (algId), or two, the algorithmDetails arg. If the algId is NULL,
 * this function will look to the algorithmDetails. If the algId is not NULL, the
 * function will determine the details from it and ignore the algorithmDetails.
 * <p>If you do not pass in an algId, you must specify the algorithmDetails using
 * one of the MOC_ASYM_KEY_ALG_ flags defined.
 * <p>It is possible that the verification process will need to digest data (not
 * the data to verify, but some other data. See, for example Probabilistic
 * Signing Scheme, PSS, which is to RSA signatures what OAEP is to RSA
 * encryption). It is also possible that in the future, an algorithm might need a
 * supporting operation other than a digest, such as a mask generating function.
 * To perform any supporting operation needed, the Verify function will build an
 * object using the array of supported Operators found in the MocCtx (built
 * during the call to MOCANA_initialize, the key object contains a reference to
 * the MocCtx). Make sure your arrays of supporting Operators contains the digest
 * Operators of algorithms needed by the signing processes you support.
 * <p>The caller passes in the address of a ubyte4, the function will deposit the
 * verification failures at that address. If, upon return, the value is 0, there
 * were no verification failures and the signature verifies. Otherwise, the value
 * will be set to one or more bits describing why the verification failed. The
 * possible values of the verification failure are the MOC_ASYM_VFY_FAIL_
 * #defines. If the result is 0, there were no failures and the signature
 * verifies. If the result is nonzero, the signature did not verify. You can then
 * look at the bits to determine why. Of course, you can simply compare to 0, if
 * zero, no failures (signature verifies), or non-zero, there was at least one
 * failure (signature does not verify).
 * <p>You can think of this result as similar to "memcmp". When memcmp returns 0,
 * the values match. If it is non-zero, the values do not match.
 * <p>Remember, the return value is success or failure of the function, not the
 * signature itself. The return from the function (MSTATUS) can be OK and the
 * verifyFailures is non-zero. In that case, the function worked, it did what it
 * was supposed to do, determine if the signature verified, so it returns OK, but
 * it sets the result of that operation, does not verify.
