 * <p>The caller supplies the key and data to encrypt, the function will allocate
 * a buffer to hold the encrypted data and return it. It is the responsibility of
 * the caller to free that memory using MOC_FREE (see mss/src/common/mstdlib.h).
 * <p>The caller can also supply a random object, as both PKCS 1.5 padding and
 * OAEP use random bytes. If no random object is provided, the function will use
 * the global random (created during the call to MOCANA_initialize or
 * MOCANA_initMocana).
 * <p>The caller specifies which padding scheme to use with the PaddingScheme
 * argument. It must be either CT_RSA_PAD_PKCS_1_5 or CT_RSA_PAD_OAEP.
 * <p>If you choose OAEP, the function will use MGF1 and specified as the

 * provide a "label" for the specified PSource. You set the oaepDigest and
 * mgfDigest args to one of the CT_DIGEST_ values (such as CT_DIGEST_SHA256). If
 * you have a label for the PSource, then pass it as the pLabel and labelLen
 * args.
 * <p>If you choose OAEP and want to use the default digest, MGF, and PSource,
 * then pass CT_DIGEST_SHA1 as the oaepDigest and mgfDigest, and NULL/0 as the
 * pLabel/labelLen.
 * <p>If you choose PKCS_1_5 as the padding scheme, there is no further
 * information needed and the oaepDigest, mgfDigest, pLabel, and labelLen args
 * are ignored.
 * <p>Note that if you choose OAEP, all digesting will be performed in software.
 * With this function, you do not have the option of using any other
 * implementation of the digest algorithms chosen.
 * <p>Note that the data to encrypt will have a maximum length. For PKCS 1
 * version 1.5, the max length is keyLen - 11. For example, with a 2048-bit key,
 * the keyLen is 256, so the max plaintext length is 245 bytes. For OAEP, the max
 * length is keyLen - ((2 * hLen) + 2) where hLen is the length of the
 * oaepDigest. For example, with a 2048-bit key and SHA-256, the max length is
 * 256 - ((2 * 32) + 2) = 256 - 66 = 190 bytes.
