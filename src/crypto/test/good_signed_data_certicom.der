8. Fixed Bugs

   a. Platform
   b. NanoCert LTE
   c. NanoEAP
   d. NanoSec
   e. NanoSSL
   f. NanoWireless
   g. Documentation

-----------
a. Platform

- On VxWorks, for TCP clients and servers, a potential memory leak that could
occur due to calling getaddrinfo has been eliminated. (Ticket 886)

---------------
b. NanoCert LTE

- PKI_CLIENT_ioctl now properly handles attempts to set key sizes to 512, which
are not supported by the certificate enrollment process due to their weakness.
(Ticket 665)

- When there are multiple foreground processes, every foreground process, by
design, receives not only its requested CRLs but also the CRLs requested by
every other foreground process, and now correctly matches the received CRL
to its (the task's) own req‚èuest. (Ticket 824)

- For revoked certificates, the verify callback now returns the correct status,
ERR_PKI_CLIENT_CERT_REVOKED (not ERR_PKI_CLIENT_NOT_FOUND). (Ticket 826)

- For certificate enrollments with future start dates, the returned status is
now ERR_CERT_START_TIME_VALID_IN_FUTURE (not ERR_CERT_EXPIRED). (Ticket 827)

- An intermittent segment fault that occurred very infrequently during
certificate enrollment has been eliminated. See also, HTTP revised functions.
(Ticket 830)

- PKI_CLIENT_init now correctly executes on ARM and SunOS. (Ticket 833)

- Certificate enrollment attempts with unreachable CMP CA URLs are now
properly handled. (Ticket 843)

- When multiple foreground processes are concurrently verifying certificates --
some good and some revoked -- the correct status is now always returned to
every process (instead of an ERR_NULL_POINTER status). (Ticket 849)

- Importing a "good" remote EE certificate, after having imported a revoked EE
certif‚èicate, now properly executes. (Ticket 859)

- Several small memory leaks that could occur when neither the primary nor
secondary CA could be reached have been eliminated. (Ticket 884)

- Certificate renewal, following certificate enrollment, now operates correctly.
(Ticket 889)

- A memory leak that occurred when importing a CA certificate, when the trust
anchor for that certificate had not been imported, has been eliminated.
(Ticket 951)

----------
c. NanoEAP

- EAP_TLSRecvData now correctly returns application data for all success cases.
(Ticket 837)

- For the EAP TTLS method, with MSCHAPv2 as phase 2, NanoEAP now correctly goes
to the FAILURE state (instead of discarding the packet). (Ticket 838)

----------
d. NanoSec

- NanoSec now operates on Linux kernel 2.6.26. (Ticket 442)

- On Fedora 10, 2.6.27, an I/O error that occurred when loading moc_memdrv.ko
has been eliminated. (Ticket 832)

----------
e. NanoSSL

- DHE_PSK negotiation now succeeds f‚èor key lengths > 255, as defined in RFC
4279. (Ticket 850)

- When ECC is enabled, an error is now properly returned by
SSL_SOCK_setServerCert if the selected algorithm does not match the server
certificate or private key type. (Ticket 964)

---------------
f. NanoWireless

- AP connectivity now works with SSIDs of 32 characters. (Ticket 840)

- AP connectivity now works from stations using AR922X wireless network adapter.
(Ticket 842)

- Message 3 of the 4-way handshake verification is now fully compliant with the
802.11i-2004 standard. (Ticket 879)

- Connectivity is now properly achieved when a supported cipher suite does not
appear first in the beacon or probe response RSN IE. (Ticket 918)

- If a reserved AKM suite is advertised by the AP, NanoWireless now correctly
does not send an association request (instead of sending a request with
an invalid RSN IE). (Ticket 920)

- When EAP Success is received with a code '5' instead of '3', NanoWireless now
proper‚èly handles the case by not proceeding to the 4-way handshake (instead
of failing completely). (Ticket 925)

- If an AP is switched off before NanoWireless sends an association request,
NanoWireless now correctly times out (instead of hanging). (Ticket 929)

- When a bad WPA IE is received, it is now properly discarded. (ticket 935)

- When no authenticator is present, the EAPOL-Start is now properly sent at
every startPeriod interval, for maxStart times (not just once). (Ticket 938)

- For WPA, the connection now correctly succeeds only after a successful group
key handshake. (Ticket 939)

- EAPOL Key message 1 with Key MIC flag set and WPA Key MIC present is now
properly ignored (rejected). (Ticket 942)

- EAPOL Key messages with the request bit set are now properly ignored
(rejected). (Ticket 943)

- 3/4 EAPOL Key messages containing Encrypted Key Data bits of '0' and an
unencrypted key data field are now properly ignored (rejected). (Ticket 944)

- Handshake m‚èessage verification (1/4 and 3/4 of 4-way handshake messages,
and 1/2 of group key handshake messages), is now completely in compliance
with the standard. (Previously some checks such as the presence of RSN IE (WPA2)
or WPA IE (WPA), or GTK KDE in the Key Data encapsulation field, were omitted).
(No ticket)

- The message parser now correctly reports errors to the calling function when
an invalid RSN IE, with a valid (>0) AKM suite count but with no actual data
bytes, is encountered. (No ticket)

- A connection success status is now properly sent only after the first
successful PTKSA (instead of after every successful PTKSA). (No ticket)


----------------
g. Documentation

- The "Cryptographic API Reference" now includes all SHA224_*, SHA384_*, and
HMAC_* functions. (Tickets 822, 823)


================================================================================
9. Known Issues

   a. NanoCert
   b. NanoCert LTE
   c. NanoDefender
   d. NanoSec
   e. Na‚ènoSSH
   f. NanoSSL
   g. NanoWireless

---------------
a. NanoCert

- If certificates contain an unknown OID in the subject field, the
CA_MGMT_extractCertDistinguishedName function returns an ERR_CERT_INVALID_STRUCT
error. (Ticket 237)

- Interoperability issues exist with JITC responders due to their
non-compliance with RFCs. (Ticket 421)

---------------
b. NanoCert LTE

- If separate foreground processes are used to import a certificate chain, then
after the application deletes any of the chain's intermediate certificates, a
foreground process call to PKI_CLIENT_verifyCertificate may fail to re-fetch
those intermediate certificates. To work around this scenario, the process in
which the PKI_CLIENT_verifyCertificate function fails should call
PKI_CLIENT_getCertId and PKI_CLIENT_deleteCert for the end certificate, which in
effect rebuilds the certificate chain. Subsequent calls to
PKI_CLIENT_verifyCertificate will then succeed. (Ticket 785)

- In multiple fo‚èreground process scenarios, if the first process fails to
connect due to inaccessible responder URLs, the second foreground process
will fail, regardless of whether its responder URLs are reachable. The
work-around is to define the __ENABLE_NONBLOCKING_SOCKET_CONNECT__ flag.
(Ticket 955)


---------------
c. NanoDefender

- The NanoDefender Mocana Code analyzer parses C code, not assembly code.
Therefore, function calls implemented in assembly code are inconveniently
blocked. The workaround is to modify the .mca file manually to include the
missing function call, and if necessary, regenerate the .msa file. (Ticket 307)

- MCA incorrectly uses the MSA library list for user functions. (Ticket 449)

----------
d. NanoSec

- On VxWorks 6.4, 8555, with hardware acceleration, MAX_ISR_JOBS must be set to 16,
not 10. (Ticket 890)

----------
e. NanoSSH

- If the NanoSSH server uses separate threads for send and receive, the SSH
client (Mocana NanoSSH or any other SSH‚è client) may experience a "bad packet"
error during key re-exchange. Instead of using separate threads, an intermediate
thread (that calls the SSH_send() and SSH_receive() functions) should be used as
a proxy to the separate send and receive threads (which will then use cleartext
only). For more information about using this unusual configuration, contact
Mocana support. (Ticket 337)

- When ASYNC and ECC/GCM are both enabled, the NanoSSH server fails.
(Ticket 956)

----------
f. NanoSSL

- The NanoSSL client returns an error when negotiating with TLS 1.2 Hello. You
can work around this problem by setting the client version to TLS 1.0 (3.1).
(Ticket 959)

---------------
g. NanoWireless

- On some Linux platforms (such as 2.6.29.4-167.fc11.i586) a segment fault can
occur when the command line client is asked to use PSK while the AP is
configured to use 802.1x. (Ticket 882)

- Upon receiving an EAP Success with type (length not equal to 4), the message
should be ¥discarded, but a connection is erroneously made. (Ticket 930)

- If a client has more than one wireless adapter, none of them can connect to
an AP. (Ticket 933)
