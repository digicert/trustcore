@brief      @moc_product IPsec/IKE functions for shutdown.

To properly stop IPsec and IKE, the following calls should be made in the order given:
+ Stop IPsec:
 + IPSEC_flush()&mdash;To release rules from the SPD (Security Policy Database) 
    and keys from the SADB (Security Association Database) within the IPsec stack.
 + <tt>RTOS_sleepMS(5000);   // wait for IKE to notify peers of dead IPsec SAs </tt>
 + Stop the IKE server&mdash;In the sample code (ike_example.c) this is done 
   by setting the while loop variable, \c isBreakSignalRequest, to \c TRUE.

+ Stop IKE:
 + IKE_shutdown()&mdash;To shutdown the IKE stack; call after exiting the 
   <tt> while (!isBreakSignalRequest)</tt> loop.
 + <tt>RTOS_sleepMS(2000);   // wait for IKE sockets to finish transmit of data</tt>
 + A function to close any open sockets.

+ Any additional clean up, such as DIGICERT_freeDigicert().
