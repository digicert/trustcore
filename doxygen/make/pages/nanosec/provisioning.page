# Provisioning

%Provisioning entails setting up security policies and (optionally) adding 
manual keying between a device and peer.

## Security Policies

@moc_product IPsec uses security policies to implement packet filtering, 
which determines whether to forward or discard a packet. By defining multiple 
security policies, you can specify different levels of security for traffic 
between different sources and destinations. For example, you could specify AES 
encryption for traffic between peers A and B, and Blowfish between peers A and 
C. IPsec policies are stored in the Security Policy Database (SPD) and SADB 
(Security Association Database), both of which are maintained in memory as part 
of the IPsec engine. Each policy (SPD entry) defines the traffic to be 
protected, how to protect it, and with whom the protection is shared. Your 
application should set up mirrored inbound and outbound policies for all 
peer-to-peer communication paths.

### Manually Adding Policies

To manually add policies from within your application code, place the following 
call after the call to IPSEC_init():
+ IPSEC_confAdd()&mdash;To add rules for the security policy database (SPD).

### Scripting Policies

An easier alternative to manually adding policies is to use the Mocana policy 
scripting feature. Simply create a text file containing the desired policies, 
and add the following call after the call IPSEC_init():
+ IPSEC_ParseScript()&mdash;To read a security policy configuration script and 
configure corresponding IPsec policies.

### Changing Policies

Whenever a user changes a configuration, the following calls should be 
made:
+ IPSEC_confDelete()&mdash;To delete a rule from the SPD.
+ IPSEC_confFlush()&mdash;To flush all rules from the SPD.

## Manual Keys

If you are using manual keys for provisioning, then your application should make 
appropriate calls to IPsec key functions.

The following call should typically be placed after the call IPSEC_init():
+ IPSEC_keyAdd()&mdash;To add manual keying (SA) between device and a peer.

In addition, the following calls should be made whenever a user makes a 
configuration change:
+ IPSEC_keyDelete()&mdash;To delete a specified manual key.
+ IPSEC_keyFlush()&mdash;To flush all manual keys from the system.
