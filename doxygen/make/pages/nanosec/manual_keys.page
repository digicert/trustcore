@brief      Using manual provisioning keys in @moc_product IPsec.

## Manual Keys

If you are using manual keys for provisioning, then your application should make 
appropriate calls to IPsec key functions.

The following call should typically be placed after the call IPSEC_init():
+ IPSEC_keyAdd()&mdash;To add manual keying (SA) between device and a peer.

In addition, the following calls should be made whenever a user makes a 
configuration change:
+ IPSEC_keyDelete()&mdash;To delete a specified manual key.
+ IPSEC_keyFlush()&mdash;To flush all manual keys from the system.
