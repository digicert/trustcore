@todo_eng_review    All the explanatory write-up was added after the 5.3.1
                    release, and should be eng-reviewed for accuracy and
                    appropriateness.

AES in CTR mode is a confidentiality-only mode. As with AES in OFB mode, you
use AES in CTR mode to use AES as a stream cipher.

@section    section_overview_aes_ctr    CTR Mode Overview

To encrypt a plaintext buffer, AES in CTR mode parses the submitted
plaintext into 128-bit blocks. The mode then encrypts a counter that it XORs
with the first plaintext block. For each subsequent block, the mode
increments the counter, encrypts it, and then XORs it with the plaintext
block. For the final plaintext block, if the last block of input is not a
full 128 bits, there is no need to pad. Instead, the value XORed internally
against the partial block of plaintext is applied bit-by-bit for the length
of the partial text block. The resultant ciphertext output buffer is the
same length as the input plaintext buffer.

@section    section_caveats_aes_ctr     Usage Caveats for AES in CTR Mode

In CTR mode, confidentiality is compromised if you reuse the counter value
under the same key. Because the counter is managed internally, there is
little danger of reusing the counter if you do not explicitly reset its
value in your DoAESCTR() call.

The most likely scenario for accidentally re-using a counter would be
calling CreateAESCTRCtx() more than once without changing the key material
input for each call. Internal to the CreateAESCTRCtx() function, the counter
is tracked using a four-byte value. Therefore, under the same key, this
function can encrypt a just over 500 GB before running out of counter
values. However, this value assumes full usage of all blocks. When planning
your key management scheme, the best practice it to never to approach this
value under a single key.
