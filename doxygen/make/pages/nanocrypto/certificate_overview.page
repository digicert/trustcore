@brief      @moc_platform certificate handling and management

A \e certificate is digital information that identifies a subject and that 
subject's key, and is digitally signed by an authority that certifies the 
certificate's information. A certificate includes the following components:
+ version
+ serial number
+ issuer
+ subject
+ expiration dates
+ certificate flags
+ signing algorithm
+ public key
+ signature

Certificate verification is a critical part of security authentication. 
Frequently, however, a party performing certificate verification does not know 
all the intermediary certificate authorities involved in a communication 
sequence. In such cases, a <em>certificate chain</em> is employed.

## Certificate Chains

A certificate chain is a collection of certificates linked together to form a 
chain of identity proof. The first certificate in a chain is the identity of a 
%server or %client, whose identity will be proven (verified) by a chain of 
certificate authorities. The \e last certificate in the chain is the root 
\e certificate. The \e issuer of a certificate is the identity vouching for the 
\e subject's identity.

A party wishing to verify a given certificate begins at the first certificate in 
a chain, and carefully verifies the certificate flags and signatures up the 
chain until the root certificate is reached. Once the root certificate is 
reached, the system then only needs to verify that the root certificate matches 
a trusted root certificate authority in order to confirm the first certificate's 
identity.

@moc_platform automatically verifies a certificate chain, checking the
relevant flags  and signatures up the chain to a root certificate for
authenticating a %client or %server certificate.

The diagram shows a certificate chain of three separate certificates. 
The arrows show equality; that is, the issuer of a certificate becomes the 
subject of the next certificate. The last certificate (the one on the right) is 
the root certificate.

The diagram shows a root certificate (on the right) and a certificate 
higher up in the certificate chain (on the left). The matching Origin (O) and 
Country (C) fields show the issuer and subject equivalence.

## Incomplete Certificate Chains

In some cases, a %server or %client may send an incomplete certificate chain, 
where the last certificate in the chain (the root certificate) is missing. In 
those instances, @moc_platform makes appropriate calls to hookup 
functions that you define in your application. Those hookup functions then 
complete the chain and verification by using the certificates found in a trusted 
certificate store.
