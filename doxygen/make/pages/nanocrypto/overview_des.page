@todo_eng_review    All the explanatory write-up was added after the 5.3.1
                    release, and should be eng-reviewed for accuracy and
                    appropriateness.

@section    section_about_des   About the DES Cipher

The DES (Data Encryption Standard) cipher is block cipher that uses a 64-bit 
block and a 56-bit key. When DES was first deployed, its key size was 
considered sufficient. However, today's computing power has left simple DES 
open to brute-force attacks. Therefore, you should consider using a 
different cipher, such as 3DES (described in three_des.dxd), or AES in CBC 
mode (described in aes.dxd).

@section    section_des_modal_usage     DES Modal Usage

The NanoCrypto DES API uses the DES cipher in CBC mode. No other modes are
directly supported.

@section    section_caveats_des     Usage Caveats for DES in CBC Mode

DES in CBC mode requires that all buffers input for encryption or decryption 
have a size that is an even multiple of the DES block size, 64 bits. If the 
buffer is smaller than an even multiple of 64 bits, you must pad the buffer 
before submitting it to the DoDES() function. To prevent leakage of 
information from the first block, CBC mode requires that you never reuse an 
initialization vector under the same key. Therefore, to encrypt a series of 
messages under the same DES key in CBC mode, you must base the 
initialization vector on a counter that is guaranteed not to repeat for as 
many \e messages (not \e blocks) as are to be encrypted under that key.

@section    section_des_cbc_padding     DES-CBC Mode Data Padding

For CBC mode, the input for encryption or decryption must be an even 
multiple of the block size. In the NanoCrypto implementation of this mode, 
if the input data does not meet this requirement, processing stops and the 
function returns an error. Therefore, you should check the size of data 
buffers before submitting them data to Nanocrypto functions that  
implement CBC mode. If the data is not an even multiple of the block 
size, you must pad it. You can pad the data however you want, and there are 
a number of schemes from which you can choose. Step 3.1 in RFC&nbsp;1321 
describes a common bit-oriented scheme. If you would prefer a byte-oriented 
padding scheme, section 6.3 of RFC 5652 provides one. You might also want to 
consider the byte-oriented scheme provided in ANSI X.923.

@section    section_des_IVs     Generating Initialization Vectors (IVs)

As input, CBC mode requires an <em>initialization
vector (IV)</em>, sometimes referred to as a \e nonce&mdash;a value used
"not more than once". The generation of this IV is external from the
NanoCrypto API functions; that is, you must handle it within your
application. Further, the message recipient must know the IV in order to
decrypt the message. For the CBC mode, the IV need not be secret, which
simplifies the problem of getting the IV to the recipient. However, to save
bandwidth, you might prefer a method in which the recipient independently
generates the IV, although such a method might not be suitable for the CBC
mode, for which the IV must be unpredictable for any given plaintext.

@warning    Appropriately managing initialization vectors is critical to the
            confidentiality of the modes that depend on IVs. Mismanaging IVs
            can destroy confidentiality.

As a source of unique nonce values, you can use a counter (as described in
Appendix B of NIST Special Publication 800-38A, 2001 Edition) or a message
number. Another commonly used method is to generate a random data block
using a FIPS-approved (and therefore cryptographically strong) random number
generator to use for the nonce. In addition, IVs for CFB mode should be
unique for all messages encrypted under the same key. Reusing an IV leaks
information on the first block of plaintext, and on any prefix shared by the
two messages.
