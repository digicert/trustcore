@todo_eng_review    All the explanatory write-up was added after the 5.3.1
                    release, and should be eng-reviewed for accuracy and
                    appropriateness.

@section    section_overview_aes_ecb    AES in ECB Mode Overview

AES in ECB mode provides rudimentary confidentiality. However, this mode is
particularly "leaky" of large-scale information in the input plaintext. For
some applications, such leakage is unacceptably compromising. Therefore, if
the need for confidentiality is high, consider using one another cipher,
such as AES in CBC mode.

@section    section_caveats_aes_ecb     Usage Caveats for AES in ECB Mode

As input, the DoAESECB() function requires that all buffers input for
encryption or decryption have a size that is an even multiple of the AES
block size, 128 bits. If the buffer is smaller than an even multiple of 128
bits, you must pad the buffer before submitting it to the DoAESECB() function.

Additionally, there are confidentiality issues that are inherent in AES in
ECB mode. In ECB mode, identical plaintext blocks result in identical
ciphertext blocks. As a result, any pattern in the plaintext that is bigger
than a block is detectable in the pattern of the output ciphertexts.

For example, if you use AES in ECB mode to encrypt a piece of black and
white line art, all blocks from white areas in the image will encrypt to the
same value. Likewise, all blocks from black areas will encrypt to the same
value (although different from the value created from the white blocks). If
you construct an image from the ciphertext blocks, you can often see that
the ciphertext for the image contains a pattern of outlines (somewhat
blurred) that conveys the general composition of the plaintext image. If
this is unacceptable, consider using a different modes.

@section    section_aes_ecb_padding     AES-ECB Mode Data Padding

For ECB mode, the input for encryption or decryption must be an even
multiple of the block size. In the NanoCrypto implementation of this mode,
if the input data does not meet this requirement, processing stops and the
function returns an error. Therefore, you should check the size of data
buffers before submitting them to NanoCrypto functions that implement ECB
modes. If the data is not an even multiple of the block size, you must pad
it. You can pad the data however you want, and there are a number of well
documented padding schemes from which you can choose. Step 3.1 in RFC&nbsp;1321
describes a common bit-oriented scheme. If you would prefer a byte-oriented
padding scheme, section 6.3 of RFC 5652 provides one. You might also want to
consider the byte-oriented scheme provided in ANSI X.923.
