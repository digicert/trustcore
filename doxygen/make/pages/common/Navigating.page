@page       navigating Navigating the API Reference
@brief      Tips and tricks for using the Doxygen-produced Web interface to
            explore and search the <em>moc_product  API
            Reference</em>.

@todo_110   (convert from DoxyS navigation to Doxygen)

This API Reference is generated directly from the @moc_platform code by
Doxygen&mdash;a C/C++ documentation tool. (This process is very similar to using
Javadoc for Java API documentation.)

@note   Be sure to scroll down and read the "What to Look For" section; it will
        definitely help you navigate through this API Reference.

## The DoxyS Interface

The HTML interface components consist of a banner, navigation pane, display tabs,
and display pane.

## Navigation Pane
The navigation pane allows you to browse through the Mocana code directory
structure, just as if you were exploring the code directly. Your current
location is shown in the <b>Directory Location Bar</b> &mdash;the navigation pane's
top line. (The directory location bar background is blue when a directory is
shown in the display pane; otherwise the background is gray.)

Depending where in the directory structure you are, the navigation pane's contents include the following:
+ <b>Directories</b> &mdash;The list of subdirectories "below" the current directory (as shown in the directory location bar).
+ <b>Pages</b> &mdash;Informational pages related to the current directory.
+ <b>Structs</b> &mdash;Structures global to the current directory.
+ <b>Functions</b> &mdash;Externally-accessible API functions in the current directory.

When you first open the <em>Mocana API Reference</em>, the banner shows
"Mocana Security Suite". The \b Directories list shows each product's code
directory, which directly corresponds to the code's structure. And the \b Pages
list includes information that is applicable to the Mocana Security Suite as a
whole.

## Banner
The banner displays two lines of information:
+ The first line tells what is currently shown in the display pane.
+ The second line provides a }breadcrumb path}&mdash;the list of navigation
links used to get to the page currently shown in the display pane. For example,
when viewing the \c funcPtrClientOpenStateUpcall description, the breadcrumb path
shows how you got there:

 -# From the top level (Mocana Security Suite) navigation pane's \b Directories options, click \b %ssl.
 -# From the %ssl navigation pane's \b Structs options, click \b %sslSettings.
 -# In the $%sslSettings$ display pane, click \b funcPtrClientOpenStateUpcall.

<b>Tip</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every \em breadcrumb in the breadcrumb path is a live
hyperlink that can be clicked to quickly return to a previous display pane's
contents or navigation pane level.

## Display Tabs
The display tabs provide options for viewing general descriptions, lists of
overview pages and code elements (such as functions and structures), and
information such as Todo lists. When you click a display tab, its background
changes to blue and the display pane's contents are updated.

## Display Pane
The display pane's contents change whenever you select an option from the
navigation pane or click a display tab.

If the display contains a long list of entries, such as the full list of
functions for the entire Mocana Security Suite, the list will be shown in a
\e compact format. You can see an item's brief description by moving your mouse
over the item's name, as shown below.

## What to Look For

As you navigate through the <em>Mocana API Reference</em>, you'll find %common elements:

- <b>Hyperlinks</b> &mdash;You'll quickly notice a plethora of hyperlinks in this API
Reference. Functions contain hyperlinks to their source files; descriptions
contain hyperlinks to related pages; pages contain hyperlinks to functions and
files; and so on. You can quickly find yourself unsure how you got to a display!
So don't forget the breadcrumb path, and of course your browser's Back button.

- <b>File lists</b> &mdash;Every directory has a page listing the files
that contain that product's externally-accessible API functions. To display the
file list, do either of the following:
 - From the navigation pane's \b Pages options, click <b>NNN Files</b> (where <b><em>NNN</em></b>
 is the name of the directory you're in, or "API Files" at the top level).
 - From the display pane's description section, click the appropriate hyperlink;
 its location varies depending on which directory you're in.

- <b>Function lists</b> &mdash;Every directory has one or more pages listing the
corresponding product's or component's externally-accessible API functions.
These lists are logical function groups, such as "EAP-FAST Functions" and
"EAP-RADIUS Functions", of the the alphabetical function list provided in the
navigation pane.

- <b>Descriptions</b> &mdash;Every page, structure, function, and so on has a description page.

- <b>Callback functions</b> &mdash;Callback functions do not appear directly in the
navigation pane. Instead, you access them through the structure in which their
function pointer is assigned. For example, the $%funcPtrLookupPSK$ callback
function description is accessible from the $%sslSettings$ structure
description.

<b>Tip</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the directories have a page that lists the
applicable callback functions and provides direct hyperlinks. For example, the
%ssl directory has a page titled, "sslSettings Callbacks".
